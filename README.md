### What is [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks. Read more about **Flask** [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).

<br />

### What is [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**React** (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. **React** can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded.

### [Material Kit React](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-react)

**Material Kit React** is a Free Material-UI@4.1.0 Kit with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's material design. You asked for it, so we built it.
